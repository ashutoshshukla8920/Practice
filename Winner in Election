Find winner of an election where votes are represented as candidate names
Input :  votes[] = {"john", "johnny", "jackie", 
                    "johnny", "john", "jackie", 
                    "jamie", "jamie", "john",
                    "johnny", "jamie", "johnny", 
                    "john"};
Output : John
We have four Candidates with name as 'John', 
'Johnny', 'jamie', 'jackie'. The candidates
John and Johny get maximum votes. Since John
is alphabetically smaller, we print it.


string findWinner(string votes[])
{
    map<string, int> mp;
    for(s : votes)
    {
        mp[s]++;
    }
    int max = -1;
    string answer;
    for(auto it = mp.begin(); it != mp.end(); it++)
    {
        if(max < it->second)
        {
            max=it->second;
            answer = it->first;
        }
    }
    return answer;
}
