Remove Minimum coins such that absolute difference between any two piles is less than K

Input: arr[] = {2, 2, 2, 2}, K = 0
Output: 0
For any two piles the difference in the number of coins is ≤ 0.
So, no need to remove any coins.

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1}, K = 3
Output: 2
If we remove one coin each from both the piles containing
5 coins, then for any two piles the absolute difference
in the number of coins is ≤ 3.


int minimumCoins (int arr[], int n, int k)
{
  int cnt = 0;
  int minVal = *min_element(arr, arr+n);
  for(i = 0; i<n; i++)
  {
      int diff  = arr[i] - minVal;
      if(diff > k)
      {
         cnt+=diff-k;
      }
  }
  return cnt;
}
