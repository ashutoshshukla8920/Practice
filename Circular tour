//Circular tour

Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. You will be given two sets of data.
1. The amount of petrol that every petrol pump has.
2. Distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.

we will be calculating deficit and usage of tank
we will check the amount of travel i to i+1 in tank
gas[i]-cost[i]
if tank < 0
   we are at deficit will update it as deficit+=tank;
   start = i+1 we will start from next pointer
   and set tank = 0;

   if deficit+tank >=0 return start else return -1;



int canCompleteCircle(int gas[], in cost[], int n)
{
   int tank =0, deficit = 0;
   for(int i  = 0; i<n ;i++)
   {
      tank += gas[i]-cost[i];
      if(tank < 0)
      {
         deficit+= tank;
         start = i+1;
         tank = 0;
      }
   }
   return tank+deficit >= 0? start:-1;
}
